# Astato Coin
<p>Astato org aims at a retail-oriented marketing approach, promoting crypto currencies throughout the business chain, with the goal of reducing or even eliminating the need for conversions for FIAT coins. The currency itself is a viable way of remunerating the project in the long run.</p>

<p>The maketing strategies to be employed are not only to promote the Astato currency, but to strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem together with the less enlightened layer of the population, shifting the focus of the approach to the daily life of the population in general, straining the technical and economic means to which the subject is restricted.</p>
